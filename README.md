# RISC-V Emulator

\[English\] \[[中文](./README_CN.md)\]

I wrote this simulator to understand riscv more accurately. RISC-V is awesome, but also very young, I hope my work can provide reference value for latecomers.

# Getting the sources, build and play

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mohanson/riscv
$ cd riscv
$ go build github.com/mohanson/cmd/riscv_emu
```

Play!

```sh
$ ./riscv_emu ./bin/fuzz
```

# Dose it done?

No! I'm just starting!
